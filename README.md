This repo contains a terraform module that creates two lambda functions
that will create AMI automatically at regular intervals. It is based on
the code at
<https://serverlesscode.com/post/lambda-schedule-ebs-snapshot-backups/> and
<https://serverlesscode.com/post/lambda-schedule-ebs-snapshot-backups-2/>.


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).
>
> <details>
> <summary><strong>Watch demo of using Atmos with Terraform</strong></summary>
> <img src="https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/blob/main/docs/demo.gif?raw=true"/><br/>
> <i>Example of running <a href="https://atmos.tools"><code>atmos</code></a> to manage infrastructure from our <a href="https://atmos.tools/quick-start/">Quick Start</a> tutorial.</i>
> </detalis>





## Usage

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
module "lambda_ami_backup" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-ami-backup.git?ref=tags/0.3.2"

  name           = "${var.name}"
  stage          = "${var.stage}"
  namespace      = "${var.namespace}"
  region         = "${var.region}"
  ami_owner      = "${var.ami_owner}"
  instance_id    = "${var.instance_id}"
  retention_days = "14"
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.





## Examples

Example on excluding some of attached EBS volumes:

```hcl
module "lambda_ami_backup" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-ami-backup.git?ref=tags/0.3.2"

  name           = "${var.name}"
  stage          = "${var.stage}"
  namespace      = "${var.namespace}"
  region         = "${var.region}"
  ami_owner      = "${var.ami_owner}"
  instance_id    = "${var.instance_id}"
  retention_days = "14"

  block_device_mappings = [
    { "DeviceName" = "/dev/xvdf", "NoDevice" = "" },
    { "DeviceName" = "/dev/xvdg", "NoDevice" = "" },
  ]
}
```
